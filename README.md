# Features

## Query History

Every time you execute a query through the editor, SSMS Plus will save that query.

You'll find your query history through the main menu

![SSMS Plus Query History](docs/illustrations/history-screen.png?raw=true "Query History")

## Schema Object Search

Use this tool to find quickly any user object in the database.

![SSMS Plus Schema Object Search](docs/illustrations/schema-search-screen.png?raw=true "Schema Object Search")

## Documents Export

This tool is handy when you want to preview or export files from the database.

The query is expecting two columns corresponding respectively to file name and file content.

* Ever Green: Focus on the latest SSMS Major Editions.

### Non Goals
* Implement domain specific features. (ex: integrate with FTP, Azure Services)
* Implement heavy or obstrusive features like intellisence.
* Seek for compatibility with an old edtion of SQL Server or SSMS.


## Debugging

### Debug the SSMS instance

This section explains how to setup Visual Studio to debug the plugin within an SSMS Instance. 

1.  In the Debug section of the main project "SSMSPlus", setup your SSMS path as the startup program.

`C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 18\Common7\IDE\Ssms.exe`

![SSMS Plus Debug Startup](docs/illustrations/debug-vs-startup.png?raw=true "Documents Export")

2.  In the VSIX section of the main project "SSMSPlus", configure the deployement path for the plugin. 

`C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 18\Common7\IDE\Extensions\SSMSPlus`
![SSMS Plus Documents Export](docs/illustrations/debug-vs-copy-vsix.png?raw=true "Documents Export")

3. That's All ! You may start your the debugging session.

### The Demo project

A [Demo project](src/Demo) is available in the sources.

It is handy for faster UI prototyping, since it does not require to launch SSMS. 

### Troubleshooting

A log record in the folder corresponding to `Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData + "\SSMS Plus"` which corresponds generally to `C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Local\SSMS Plus`.

Theses logs are very useful for diagnostics.
